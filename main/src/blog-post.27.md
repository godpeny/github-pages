## Basics
Independent Component Analysis attempts to decompose a multivariate signal into independent non-Gaussian signals. It aims to find a linear transformation of data that maximizes statistical independence among the components.  
ICA is widely applied in fields like audio, image processing, and biomedical signal analysis to isolate distinct sources from mixed signals.
