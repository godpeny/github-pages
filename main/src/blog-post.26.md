## Eigenvector and Eigenvalue
An eigenvector is a vector that has its direction unchanged by a given linear transformation.  
Consider an $n{\times }n$ matrix A and a nonzero vector $v$ of length $n$. 
If multiplying $A$ with $v$ (denoted by $A v$) simply scales $v$ by a factor of $\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is a scalar, then $v# is called an eigenvector of $A$, and $\lambda$ is the corresponding eigenvalue. This relationship can be expressed as,
$$
A v =\lambda v
$$
Above formula can be stated equivalently as $\left(A - \lambda I \right)v = 0$
where $I$ is the $n \times n$ identity matrix and $0$ is the zero vector.
