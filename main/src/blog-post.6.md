### Gradient
The gradient of a scalar-valued differentiable function $f$ of several variables is the vector field (or vector-valued function) $\nabla f$ whose value at a point $p$ gives the direction and the rate of fastest increase.  
When a coordinate system is used in which the basis vectors are not functions of position, the gradient is given by the vector whose components are the partial derivatives of $f$ at $p$.  
That is, for $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, its gradient $\nabla f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is defined at the point $p = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ n n-dimensional space as the vector.  
$
[
\nabla f(p) = 
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_1}(p) \\
\vdots \\
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_n}(p)
]$

## Epsilon in Calculus
- Epsilon is a small positive number, often used in numerical computation to avoid division by zero or taking the logarithm of zero.
