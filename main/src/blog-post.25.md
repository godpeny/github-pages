### Jensen's Inequality
Jensen's inequality generalizes the statement that the secant line(a line that intersects a curve at a minimum of two distinct points) of a convex function lies above the graph of the function. In the context of probability theory, it is generally stated in the following form: if $X$ is a random variable and $\mathbb{E}$ is a convex function, then
$$
\varphi(\mathbb{E}[X]) \leq \mathbb{E}[\varphi(X)]
$$
The difference between the two sides of the inequality is called the Jensen gap.
$$
\varphi(\mathbb{E}[X]) - \mathbb{E}[\varphi(X)]
$$
