## Terminology
### Variables vs Parameters
##### Train, Dev, Test Set
train on the training set, evaluate results on the dev set, and test on the test set.
so do not test your model on the test set until you have finished handling overfitting.

## Math
### Statistics
#### L2 Norm
#### Gaussian Distribution (= Normal Distribution)
#### Probability vs Likelihood
#### Cumulative Distribution Function(CDF) vs Probability Density Function(PDF) vs Probability Mass Function(PMF)
#### Expectation vs Mean vs Average

### Calculus
#### Chain Rule
#### Jacobian vs Gradients vs Hessian
#### Differential vs Derivative vs Gradient
#### Epsilon in Calculus
- Epsilon is a small positive number, often used in numerical computation to avoid division by zero or taking the logarithm of zero.
#### Epsilon-Delta Definition of Limit


### Linear Algebra
#### Vector and Matrix
